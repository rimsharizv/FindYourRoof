## Description
FindYourRoof is an innovative application aimed at tackling homelessness by facilitating connections between homeless individuals and housing/job opportunities. Developed for non-profit organizations, this platform serves as a bridge to reintegrate homeless individuals into society, offering features like secure document storage and mentorship connections.
